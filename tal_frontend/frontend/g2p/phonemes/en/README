### 英文单音字/多音字字典

## 英文单词的处理
1、英文单词中只保留了 点：.  诸如 短横线: -  撇 ' 等都被去除掉，并且所有单词都转换成小写
2、合并 cmudict 和 en_pron.dict，相同单词保留cmudit 里的发音
3、从合并好的单词中，去除。en_polyphone_tal.txt 包含的单词

## cmudict
cmu英文字典，字典中单词可能有多个发音，发音不同仅由发音习惯、重读等音素导致，与语意、时态等因素无关，默认选取第一种发音

## en_polyphone_tal.txt
刘惶老师提供的英文多音字列表

## en_pron.dict
新科老师提供的英文发音字典


## en_monophone_tal.txt
英文单音字字典


注：cmu中 mr mr. 的发音是一样的
之前刘惶老师提供的参考是 mr 发 M 和 R 两个音 mr. 发 M IH1 S T ER0
这一点需要统一：
目前的想法是 如果单词 全大写且字典里没有转换成小写的输入，拆离成单个字母
例如 WTO -> wto -> not in dict -> w t o
               -> in dict -> dict.get('wto')
